# Build
In order to build this software, you need to have CMake installed on your system.

If you are on Windows and using Visual Studio, chances are, you already have CMake installed by default.
To access it, you need to open the Start Menu entry called "Developer Command Prompt" (or something similar).
Then you change directory to this repo folder and type "cmake .".
